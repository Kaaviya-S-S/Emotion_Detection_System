# 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Detection System
This project presents a real-time emotion detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) enhanced with Uniform Local Binary Patterns (uLBP) for robust facial feature extraction. The system is designed with data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization, making it highly applicable in human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring domains.
